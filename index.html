            Hi my name is James. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the 
            printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
            industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an 
            unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make 
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, 
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
            release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
            more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
